                Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact
                craters. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that
                title
                belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping
                around
                the
                Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.

        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close
            to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at
            night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).

        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.
            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar
            radiation that
            characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.</p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of
            Earth. If
            Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
            <br><br>

            From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away
            from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
            distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million
            kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds around the
            Sun
            every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any
            other
            planet.
            <br><br>

            Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is
            moving
            fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not
            accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise
            briefly,
            set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset
            for
            other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days –
            just
            over two years on Mercury.

            <br><br>
            Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the
            Sun.
            That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons as many other planets
            do.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mercury doesn't have moons.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mercury doesn't have rings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust
            together to form this
            small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky
            mantle, and a solid crust.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off
            the surface by the
            solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen,
            helium, and potassium.</p>
