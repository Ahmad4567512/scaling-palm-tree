                Neptune is the eighth, and most distant planet from the Sun. It’s the fourth-largest, <br>
                and the first planet discovered with math.

                <br>
                Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact
                craters. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that
                title
                belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping
                around
                the
                Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.

    <br>
    <p style="padding-left: 200px;">Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most
        distant major planet or biting our Sun.
        <br><br>
        More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. The planet’s blue
        color comes from methane in its atmosphere, <br> which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but allows blue ones to
        be
        reflected back into space – very much like its neighbor, Uranus. Neptune was the first planet located using
        math.
        <br>
        German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the
        Roman god of the sea.

        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far
            from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011
            Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
            <br><br>
            Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The
            warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.


        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations. Using
            predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846.
            The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier.
            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and
            materials <br>
            that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme, and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 kilometers), Neptune is about four times
            wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune
            makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth
            days).
            <br><br>
            Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric,
            oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This switch,
            in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never
            crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This
            repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies.
            <br><br>
            Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which
            is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do
            on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Neptune has 16 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on Oct. 10, 1846, by
            William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named
            for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.
            <br></br>
            Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the
            planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that
            Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit
            (minus 235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers
            spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by
            Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet
            know why.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far.
            Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and
            Adams. The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <img style="padding-left: 170px; width: 1270px;" class="planet-image3"
            src="img/Fuzzy_image_of_Neptunes_rings.webp" alt="">
        <br><br><br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Neptune's ring system also has peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Liberté
            (Liberty), Egalité (Equality), Fraternité (Fraternity), and Courage are in the outermost ring, Adams. The
            arcs are strange because the laws of motion would predict that they would spread out evenly rather than stay
            clumped together. Scientists now think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the
            ring, stabilizes these arcs.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when
            gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely
            formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of
            methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue,
            giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989,
            show Neptune as a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal
            clouds and other distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that
            Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images, showing the planets look much
            more alike than many thought.
            <br><br>
            Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun,
            Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds
            whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000
            kilometers per hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per
            hour).
            <br><br>
            In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the "Great Dark Spot" was large
            enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on
            different parts of the planet.
