                Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it's the
                only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be
                discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA's Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the
                first dwarf planet to be explored by a spacecraft.
                <br><br>
                Called an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors
                that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid
                belt's total mass, Pluto is still 14 times more massive.
                <br><br>
                Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name.

        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and
            it's the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt
            to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA's Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the
            first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft.
            <br><br>
            Called an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that
            scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid belt's
            total mass, Pluto is still 14 times more massive.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same
            name.


            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for
            possible signs of life. Ceres has something a lot of other planets don't: water. Here on Earth, water is
            essential for life, so it's possible someplace else with that ingredient and a few other conditions could
            support life, as well. If anything does live on Ceres, it's likely to be very small microbes similar to
            bacteria. If Ceres does not have living things today, there may be signs it harbored life in the past.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With a radius of 296 miles (476 kilometers), Ceres is 1/13 the radius of Earth. If Earth were
            the size of a nickel, Ceres would be about as big as a poppy seed.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 257 million miles (413 million kilometers), Ceres is 2.8 astronomical units away
            from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
            distance, it takes sunlight 22 minutes to travel from the Sun to Ceres.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Ceres takes 1,682 Earth days, or 4.6 Earth years, to make one trip around the Sun. As Ceres orbits the Sun,
            it completes one rotation every 9 hours, making its day length one of the shortest in the solar system.
            <br><br>
            Ceres' axis of rotation is tilted just 4 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That
            means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn't experience seasons like other more tilted planets do.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Ceres does not have any moons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Ceres does not have any rings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity
            pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an "embryonic
            planet," which means it started to form but didn't quite finish. Nearby Jupiter's strong gravity prevented
            it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location
            among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Ceres has a very thin atmosphere, and there is evidence it contains water vapor. The vapor may
            be produced by ice volcanoes or by ice near the surface sublimating (transforming from solid to gas).
