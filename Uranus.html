                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third largest planet in our solar system – about
                four times wider than Earth.
                <br><br>
                Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small
                moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes
                Uranus appear to spin on its side. Uranus is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane, which
                absorbs red light but allows blues to be reflected back into space.

        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28
            small moons. Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes
            Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.
            <br><br>
            Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
            William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later
            that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer
            Johann Elert Bode.


        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George
            III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.
            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and
            materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider
            than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical
            units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
            From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin once
            around its axis. Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth
            years (30,687 Earth days).
            <br><br>
            Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77
            degrees. This may be the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This unique tilt causes
            Uranus to have the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the
            Sun shines directly over each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a 21-year-long, dark winter.
            <br><br>
            Uranus is also one of just two planets that rotate in the opposite direction than most of the planets. Venus
            is the other.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Uranus has 28 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names
            from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of
            William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
            <br><br>
            All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer
            moons remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text text-primary">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark
            grey rings. There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar
            system, and the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.
            <br><br>
            In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta,
            Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust.

        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago – when
            gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely
            formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the
            seventh planet from the Sun.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of
            water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.
            <br><br>
            While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby in
            1986 – more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox,
            including rapidly changing bright features.
            <br><br>
            Uranus' planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even
            colder than Neptune in some places.
            <br><br>
            Wind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are retrograde at
            the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the planet’s rotation. But closer to the poles, winds shift
            to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus' rotation.
