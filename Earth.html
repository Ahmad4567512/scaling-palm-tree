                While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar
                system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of
                the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
                <br><br>
                Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman
                mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of
                course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet
                from the Sun.

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named
            after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means
            “the ground.”</p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext"> Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant
            here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the
            temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a
            convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
            <br><br>
            Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing
            effects of climate change.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the
            terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet in our solar system.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical
            unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to
            Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
            <br><br>
            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.


        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one
            trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts
            one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four
            years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.
            <br><br>
            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.
            This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted
            toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is
            greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six
            months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal
            amounts of heat from the Sun.


        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar
            object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It
            stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.
            <br><br>
            Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by Earth's
            gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in a
            long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.
            <br><br>
            Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a
            collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into it,
            displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a
            radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after
            Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).
            <br><br>
            The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. That means 30 Earth-sized
            planets could fit in between Earth and its Moon.


        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Earth has no rings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed
            when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow
            terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">VNear the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1%
            other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and
            short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It also
            protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky,
            before they can strike the surface as meteorites.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Surface</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth's lithosphere, which
            includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are
            constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at
            a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride
            up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.
            <br><br>
            Earth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5
            miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth's water. Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under
            these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is
            underwater. Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic
            oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.
