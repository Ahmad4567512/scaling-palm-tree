                Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet. It’s the hottest planet in our
                solar system.

                Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, and often called Earth’s twin. But pull up a
                bit closer, and Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has
                a surface hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a
                smear of light.

        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the
            third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from
            most planets.
            <br>

            Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick
            atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with
            surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes
            and deformed mountains.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the
            five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most
            important gods.
            <br>

            Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient
            Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god.


            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to
            158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius). This temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, such as
            “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s
            surface.
            <br><br>
            At the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we
            find another transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why
            these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of
            absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
            <br><br>
            The most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron
            chloride. Although it's much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study
            astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note
            that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with
            a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb
            potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.
            <br><br>
            Some of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in
            length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.
            <br><br>
            None of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the
            questions they raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, and its hellish
            history, make a compelling case for missions to investigate our temperamental sister planet. There is much,
            it would seem, that she can teach us.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), or
            0.72 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.
            From this distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus. <br>

            Earth's nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth. Its
            diameter at its equator is about 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers), versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for
            Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients,
            therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and
            an evening star. That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.
            <br><br>
            Because Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far
            from each other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position
            (seen in the morning), then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.
            <br><br>
            At its nearest to Earth, Venus is about 24 million (about 38 million kilometers) away. But most of the time
            the two planets are farther apart. The maximum distance between Venus and Earth is about 162 million miles
            (261 million kilometers). Mercury, the innermost planet, actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity than
            Venus.
            <br><br>
            One more trick of perspective: how Venus looks through binoculars or a telescope. Keep watch over many
            months, and you’ll notice that Venus has phases, just like our Moon – full, half, quarter, etc. The complete
            cycle, however, new to full, takes 584 days, while our Moon takes just a month. And it was this perspective,
            the phases of Venus first observed by Galileo through his telescope, that provided the key scientific proof
            for the Copernican heliocentric nature of the solar system.
            <br><br>

            From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away
            from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
            distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience – that is, if your spacecraft or spacesuit
            could protect you from temperatures in the range of 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 Celsius). For one thing,
            your “day” would be 243 Earth days long – longer even than a Venus year (one trip around the Sun), which
            takes only 225 Earth days. For another, because of the planet's extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset
            would take 117 Earth days. And by the way, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, because Venus
            spins backward compared to Earth.
            <br><br>

            While you’re waiting, don’t expect any seasonal relief from the unrelenting temperatures. On Earth, with its
            spin axis tilted by about 23 degrees, we experience summer when our part of the planet (our hemisphere)
            receives the Sun’s rays more directly – a result of that tilt. In winter, the tilt means the rays are less
            direct. No such luck on Venus: Its very slight tilt is only three degrees, which is too little to produce
            noticeable seasons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Venus is one of only two planets in our solar system that doesn't have a moon, but it does have
            a quasi-satellite that has officially been named Zoozve. This object was discovered on Nov. 11, 2002, by
            Brian Skiff at the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) in Flagstaff, Arizona, a project
            funded by NASA that ended in February 2008.
            <br><br>
            Quasi-satellites, sometimes called quasi-moons, are asteroids that orbit the Sun while staying close to a
            planet. A quasi-satellite’s orbit usually is more oblong and less stable than the planet's orbit. In time,
            the shape of a quasi-satellite’s orbit may change and it may move away from the planet.
            <br><br>
            According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the organization that names space objects, Zoozve
            is the first-identified quasi-satellite of a major planet. Earth also has quasi-satellites, including a
            small asteroid discovered in 2016.
            <br><br>
            Based on its brightness, scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) estimate Zoozve ranges in size
            from 660 feet (200 meters) to 1,640 feet (500 meters) across.
            <br><br>
            Interestingly, Zoozve also orbits relatively close to Earth but does not pose a threat to our planet. For
            the next 175 years, the closest Zoozve will get to Earth is in the year 2149 when it will be about 2.2
            million miles (3.5 million kilometers) away, or about 9 times the distance from Earth to the Moon.
            <br><br>
            How Zoozve Got Its Name
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Venus has no rings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable
            planets get their start? The close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates,
            provide a kind of test case for scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior
            structure, both harboring oceans in their younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the
            only known world to host abundant life. The factors that set these planets on almost opposite paths began,
            most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago
            that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the planets we know today. Better knowledge of
            the formation history of Venus could help us better understand Earth – and rocky planets around other stars.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from
            the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is
            mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed
            of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion.
            But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease.</p>
