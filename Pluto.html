            <p class="px-5">
                Pluto is a dwarf planet located in a distant region of our solar system beyond Neptune known as the
                Kuiper Belt.
                <br><br>
                Pluto was long considered our ninth planet, but the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto
                as a dwarf planet in 2006. NASA's New Horizons was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up close,
                flying by in 2015. Pluto was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. It was named by
                11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England.

        Pluto is by far the most famous dwarf planet. Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was long considered
        our solar system's ninth planet <br>. But after other astronomers found similar intriguing worlds deeper in the
        distant Kuiper Belt – the IAU reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.

    <p class="ptext">
        There was widespread outrage on behalf of the demoted planet. Textbooks were updated, and the internet spawned
        memes
        with Pluto going <br>
        through a range of emotions, from anger to loneliness.
        <br><br>
        On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight through the Pluto system – providing
        the
        first close-up images of <br>
        Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that has transformed our understanding of
        these mysterious worlds on the solar system’s outer frontier.
        <br><br>
        Dwarf planet Ceres is closer to home. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter,
        and
        it's the only dwarf planet <br>
        located in the inner solar system. Like Pluto, Ceres also was once classified as a
        planet. Ceres was the first dwarf planet to be visited by a spacecraft – NASA’s Dawn mission.

        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and glaciers.
            It is located in the distant Kuiper Belt.
            <br><br>
            Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of
            similar worlds deeper in the Kuiper Belt, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the
            International Astronomical Union.
            <br><br>
            According to the 2006 IAU Resolution, "a dwarf planet is an object in orbit around the Sun that is large
            enough to pull itself into a nearly round shape but has not been able to clear its orbit of debris." The IAU
            stated that Pluto falls into the dwarf planet category because it is located in a part of our solar system
            known as the Trans-Neptunian region (beyond Neptune) where other objects might cross Pluto's orbital path.
            <br><br>
            Pluto is only about 1,400 miles wide. At that small size, Pluto is only about half the width of the United
            States. It's about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of
            nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. On average, Pluto’s temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too
            cold to sustain life.
            <br><br>
            Pluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto
            itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. Pluto and
            Charon are often referred to as a "double planet."
            <br><br>
            The only spacecraft to explore Pluto up close was NASA's New Horizons. It flew by the dwarf planet and its
            moons in 2015.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">
            Pluto was named by an 11-year-old girl.
            <br><br>
            In 1930, Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, suggested to her grandfather that the new discovery be named for
            the Roman god of the underworld. He forwarded the name to the Lowell Observatory and it was selected.
            <br><br>
            In an interview with NASA in January 2006, Venetia said she offered the name Pluto over breakfast with her
            mother and grandfather. It was March 14, 1930, and her grandfather, Falconer Madan, had announced that
            scientists discovered the ninth planet.
            <br><br>
            "Venetia's interest and success in naming Pluto as a schoolgirl caught the attention of the world and earned
            her a place in the history of planetary astronomy that lives on," said Alan Stern, the principal
            investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission that flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015.
            <br><br>
            Pluto's place in mythology can get a little muddled, so we asked Dr. Elizabeth Vandiver, chair of the
            Department of Classics in Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, to clarify the origins of the name.
            <br><br>
            Here is her reply:
            <br><br>
            "Pluto is the name of the Roman god of the underworld, equivalent to the Greek Hades.
            <br><br>
            However, the Greek name "Plouton" (from which the Romans derived their name "Pluto") was also occasionally
            used as an alternative name for Hades. But Pluto is definitely the Roman spelling."


            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it's unlikely that life could exist there. At such
            cold temperatures, water, which is vital for life as we know it, is essentially rock-like. Pluto's interior
            is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep inside.

        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Pluto has an equatorial diameter of about 1,477 miles (2,377 kilometers). Pluto is about 1/5th
            the width of Earth.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of about 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers), Pluto is about 39 times
            farther away than the Earth is from the Sun. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from
            the Sun to Pluto.
            <br><br>
            If you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the Sun would be 1/900 the brightness it is here on
            Earth, or about 300 times as bright as our full moon. There is a moment each day near sunset here on Earth
            when the light is the same brightness as midday on Pluto.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Pluto's orbit around the Sun is unusual compared to the planets: it's both elliptical and tilted. Pluto's
            248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as
            close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150
            million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun,
            or 39 AU.
            <br><br>
            From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was
            actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.

            One day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane
            of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation;
            spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus.


        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have
            formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.
            <br><br>
            Charon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest
            satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. It orbits Pluto at a distance of just 12,200
            miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our Moon is 20 times farther away from Earth. Pluto and Charon
            are often referred to as a double planet.
            <br><br>
            Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours – the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation. This
            means Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of
            Charon always faces Pluto, a state called tidal locking.
            <br><br>
            Pluto's other four moons are much smaller, less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide. They're also
            irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are
            not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.
            <br><br>
            Pluto's moons are named for other mythological figures associated with the underworld. Charon is named for
            the river Styx boatman who ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Charlene, the wife of
            discoverer James Christy, who was nicknamed Char). The small moon Nix is named for the goddess of darkness
            and night, who is also the mother of Charon. Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent that guards the
            underworld. Kerberos is named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology (known as Fluffy in the Harry
            Potter novels). And Styx is named for the mythological river that separates the world of the living from the
            realm of the dead.

            There are no known rings around Pluto.
