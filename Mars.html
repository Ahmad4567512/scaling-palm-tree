    <br>
    <p style="padding-left: 200px;">Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold.
        The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other).
        Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.
        <br><br>
        Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers – like NASA's Perseverance rover – are serving as
        pathfinders to eventually get humans to the surface of the Red Planet.

                rovers to explore the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much

        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where
            we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much
            wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.
            <br><br>
            Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. The
            Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."
            <br><br>
            Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or
            rust, causing the surface to look red.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
            reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for example, the
            Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red
            Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.
            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're
            looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth
            were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away
            from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this
            distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on
            Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols,
            which is the same as 687 Earth days.
            <br><br>
            Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is
            another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct
            seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because
            it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months
            (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit
            around the Sun.
            <br><br>
            Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the
            northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern summer is
            154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're
            potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.
            <br><br>
            The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <img style="padding-left: 300px; width: 1000px; height: auto;" src="simg/moonmars.webp" alt="">
        <br><br>
        <p class="ptext"> Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface.
            It is
            slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.
            <br><br>
            Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped
            Deimos is covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than
            pockmarked Phobos.
        </p>


        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart,
            it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet.


        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed
            when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half
            the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a
            solid crust.

        </p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our
            eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on
            Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites,
            asteroids, and comets.
            <br><br>
            The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225
            degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily
            escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like
            spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees
            Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).
            <br><br>
            Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After
            such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.
