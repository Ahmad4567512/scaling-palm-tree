    <h1 class="text-success" style="padding-left: 200px; font-size: 40px; font-weight: bold;">Jupiter Overview</h1>
    <br><br>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="text">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water,
            floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the
            lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great
            Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
            <br><br>
            The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its moons are also
            named for mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Namesake</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.
            <br>
        <h1 class="text">Potential for Life
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures,
            pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for
            organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of
            its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is
            evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.

        </p>
        <h1 class="text">Size and Distance
        </h1>
        <p class="ptext">With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If
            Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.
            <br><br>
            From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units
            away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From
            this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h1 class="text">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it
            takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year
            in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).
            <br><br>
            Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter
            spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Moons</h1>

        <p class="ptext">With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.
            <br><br>
            Jupiter has 95 moons that are officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The four
            largest moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei
            in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are known today as the Galilean
            satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system.
            <br><br>
            Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar
            system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of
            current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen
            crust of Europa, the target of NASA's Europa Clipper mission slated to launch in 2024.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Rings</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise. The rings
            are composed of small, dark particles, and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data
            from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as
            interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text">Formation</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity
            pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after
            the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the
            solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to
            ignite.
            <br><br>
            About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is
            the fifth planet from the Sun.

        </p>

        <h1 class="text">Atmosphere</h1>

        <p class="ptext">Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful stripes and spots – the cloud bands that
            encircle the planet, and the cyclonic storms dotting it from pole to pole. The gas planet likely has three
            distinct cloud layers in its "skies" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top
            cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide
            crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.
            <br><br>
            The vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing
            gases rising from the planet's warmer interior. Jupiter's fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours –
            creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.
            <br><br>
            With no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept
            by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the
            equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the
            giant planet for more than 300 years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot,
            about half the size of its larger cousin.
            <br><br>
            Findings from NASA’s Juno probe released in October 2021 provide a fuller picture of what’s going on below
            those clouds. Data from Juno shows that Jupiter’s cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric
            densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the
            opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom.
            <br><br>
            The findings also indicate these storms are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100
            kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350
            kilometers). This surprising discovery demonstrates that the vortices cover regions beyond those where water
            condenses and clouds form, below the depth where sunlight warms the atmosphere.
            <br><br>
            The height and size of the Great Red Spot mean the concentration of atmospheric mass within the storm
            potentially could be detectable by instruments studying Jupiter’s gravity field. Two close Juno flybys over
            Jupiter’s most famous spot provided the opportunity to search for the storm’s gravity signature and
            complement the other results on its depth.
            <br><br>
            With their gravity data, the Juno team was able to constrain the extent of the Great Red Spot to a depth of
            about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops.
