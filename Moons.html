                Earth’s
                closest celestial neighbor plays a pivotal role in the <br>

            Overview
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 150;">Earth's Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky. The Moon makes
            Earth a more livable planet
            by moderating our <br>
            home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes
            tides, creating a rhythm that has guided <br> humans for thousands of years.

            The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago.
            <br>

            Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed
            until Galileo Galilei <br>
            discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. In Latin, the Moon was called Luna,
            which is the main adjective for all things Moon- <br>related: lunar.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h1 class="text">Weather on the Moon</h1>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p class="ptext">
            On the Moon, snow does not fall. Thunder never rolls. No clouds form in the pitch-black sky. “Weather” on
            the Moon means <br> something completely different than it does on Earth. The lunar climate is dominated by
            temperature swings of hundreds <br> of degrees, incoming space rocks of all sizes, and particles and energy
            traveling from the Sun and beyond.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 175px ;">Extreme Exosphere</h5>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            Searing heat and bone-chilling cold are both common on the Moon, and changes in temperature are quick and
            dramatic, <br> because the Moon doesn’t have an atmosphere like Earth does. One cubic centimeter of Earth’s
            atmosphere contains one hundred trillion <br> times as many molecules as the same amount of space near the
            lunar
            surface. In other words, the lunar environment is almost empty, <br> but not quite. The barely-there layer
            of gas
            around the Moon is called an exosphere.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <p class="ptext">
            The lunar exosphere is too skimpy to trap or spread the Sun’s energy, so differences between sunlit and
            shadowed areas on the Moon <br> are extreme. Temperatures near the Moon’s equator can spike to 250°F (121°C)
            in
            daylight, then plummet after nightfall to -208°F (-133°C). <br> In deep craters near the Moon’s poles,
            permanent
            shadows keep the surface even colder — NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has <br> measured temperatures
            lower
            than -410°F (-246°C). These forever-dark places harbor ice deposits that may be billions of years old.

        <p class="ptext">A trifecta of labels is being applied to the Moon of Aug. 19, 2024. It’s a full moon, a
            supermoon, and finally a blue moon. You may <br> hear it referred to as a super blue moon or blue supermoon
            as a
            result. It sounds exciting, but what does that really mean? We’ve got you covered.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;  padding-left: 175px; font-weight: bold; "> What is a supermoon?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">The Moon travels around our planet in an elliptical orbit, or an elongated circle, with Earth
            closer to one side of the ellipse. <br> Each month, the Moon passes through the point closest to Earth
            (perigee)
            and the point farthest from Earth (apogee). When <br> the Moon is at or near its closest point to Earth at
            the
            same time as it is full, it is called a “supermoon.” During this event, because <br> the full moon is a
            little
            bit closer to us than usual, it appears especially large and bright in the sky.
            <br><br>
            Because the Moon’s orbit wobbles and differs depending on where the Sun and Earth are in their orbits, the
            exact distance of <br> these closest and furthest points varies. But the Moon can look up to 14 percent
            bigger at
            perigee than apogee.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;  padding-left: 175px; font-weight: bold;"> Will the Moon be blue?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">No, that’s just the term for two full moons in a month, or the third full moon in a season with
            four.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;  padding-left: 175px; font-weight: bold;"> Is the Moon ever blue?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">
            On rare occasions, tiny particles in the air ― typically of smoke or dust ― can scatter away red wavelengths
            <br>
            of light, causing the Moon to appear blue.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;  padding-left: 175px; font-weight: bold;">
            Will this Moon be bigger and more “super?”
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">You probably won’t notice a big difference in size. When the Moon is closest to Earth (a
            “supermoon”), it can look up to <br> 14 percent bigger than when it’s farthest from Earth. This is similar
            to the
            size difference between a quarter and a nickel. <br> Because the Moon will be close to us in its orbit, it
            will
            appear a bit brighter than usual.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;  padding-left: 175px; font-weight: bold;">
            Do blue moons and supermoons always occur <br>
            together?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p class="ptext">No. The term “supermoon” is used to describe a full Moon that occurs within a day or so of
            perigee, so they
            happen three <br> to four times a year. About 25 percent of all full moons are supermoons, but only 6
            percent of
            full moons are blue moons (seasonal and monthly). <br>
            The time between super blue moons is quite irregular ― it
            can be as much as 20 years ― but in general, 10 years is the average. <br> However, if you like to celebrate
            both
            seasonal and monthly blue moons, the gap is closer to five years.
            <br><br>
            Monthly blue moons always occur in the last two or three days of the month. A monthly blue moon in January
            is usually <br> followed by another one in March of the same year. And in fact, the next monthly super blue
            moons
            will occur as a pair, in January <br> and March 2037. Seasonal blue moons always occur almost exactly one
            month
            before an equinox or a solstice. The next seasonal <br> blue moon will be on Aug. 21, 2032.
