                The term “astronaut” derives from the Greek words meaning “star sailor,” <br>
                and refers to all who have been
                launched as crew members <br> aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond. The term “astronaut”
                <br>
                has
                been maintained as the title for those selected to <br> join the NASA corps of astronauts who make “star
                <br>
                sailing” their career profession.

            <p class="px-5">
                With more than 20 years of operations in low Earth orbit, we are preparing our return to the Moon for
                long-term exploration and discovery before taking the next giant leap to Mars.
                <br><br>
                Never has humanity endeavored to simultaneously architect multinational infrastructures in lunar orbit,
                on the lunar surface, and at Mars — all while maintaining high-demand government and private-sector
                operations in low Earth orbit.

            <p class="px-5">
                Human space exploration helps to address fundamental questions about our place in the universe and the
                history of our solar system.
                <br><br>
                NASA’s exploration vision is anchored in providing value for humanity by answering some of the most
                fundamental questions: Why are we here? How did it all begin? Are we alone? What comes next?
